        <p>Instagram has been betting big on the Reels part and is often seen bringing new updates for it. The recent one will allow people to turn their photos into Remixes, allowing people to form some intriguing Reels. This comes after the social media platform introduced the ability to remix Reels.</p>
        <h1>Instagram Photo Remixes Introduced</h1>
        <p>Another change to expect in the coming weeks is the conversion of video posts into Reels. New video posts, less than 15 minutes in duration, will be turned into Reels. These will appear in a full-screen format, much like how Reels appear on the platform. This ability was previously a test and has now been made official. Old video posts will remain so.</p>
